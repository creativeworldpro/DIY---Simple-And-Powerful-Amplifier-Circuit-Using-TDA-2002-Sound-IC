In this project, we are going to show you making a simple and powerful amplifier circuit using TDA 2002 Sound IC. It is a very simple and powerful amplifier circuit, that you can make this at home easily. For power supply we use only DC-12v.


Component List :

1. Sound IC – TDA 2002
2. Capacitor –  1000µf/25v
                 220µf/16v
                   1µf/50v
3. Resistor – 2.2 Ω
              220 Ω
4. Polyester Film Capacitor – 2A 104J
5. Sound Speaker
6. Audio Input Cable
7. Power Source – DC 12v
8. Heat Sink
9. 

Circuit  connection  -  

1st we connect 1µf/50v capacitor positive leg with 1no leg of IC. Then we connect 220µf/16v capacitor positive leg with 2no leg of sound IC. Now we connect resistor with the circuit. Connect 2.2 Ω resistor with 220µf/16v capacitor negative leg.


Now we connect 1000µf/25v capacitor with the circuit. Connect capacitor positive leg with 4no leg of sound IC. Again we connect Polyester Film Capacitor with 4no leg of sound IC. Then we connect 2.2 Ω resistor with empty terminal of polyester film capacitor. 

This time, we connect both empty terminal of 2.2 Ω resistor. Now we connect 220 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 4no leg of sound IC & other terminal with 220µf/16v capacitor negative leg.

Using a blank cable, we connect sound IC 3no leg with 2.2 Ω resistor. Now we connect sound speaker with the circuit. Connect one speaker cable with 3no leg of sound IC  and connect another speaker cable with empty terminal  of 1000µf/25v capacitor.

It is the time to connect audio input cable, with the circuit. We connect audio input ground cable with 3no leg of sound IC and connect audio input L/R cable with empty terminal of 1µf/50v capacitor.
Finally, we connect power source with the circuit. We connect DC-12v negative cable with 3no leg of sound IC  and connect DC-12v positive cable with 5no leg of sound IC.

Our circuit is completely ready for use. Now just connect heat sink with the sound IC, then plug-in power and play music.
